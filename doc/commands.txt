A note on version control
-------------------------
When using version control it is recommended to control certain files but
exclude others. The following list describes the default files created by
'android create project'. Files listed as 'control' should be included in
version control, files listed as ignore should be excluded, and files listed as
'delete' are unnecessary.

Furthermore, some files marked with '*' and '~' are not really needed but would
require minor modifications if they are removed.

     control - build.xml
     control - AndroidManifest.xml
    *control - ant.properties
    *control - project.properties
    *ignore  - local.properties
     delete  - proguard-project.txt

     control - src/org/sfvlug/tutorial/SfvLug.java

    ~control - res/values/strings.xml
     control - res/layout/main.xml

    *control - res/drawable-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png
    *control - res/drawable-hdpi/ic_launcher.png
    *control - res/drawable-mdpi/ic_launcher.png
    *control - res/drawable-ldpi/ic_launcher.png
